Dependencies
============
To effectively use this `Caliper-python` package, you will need to have Python,
pip, and setuptools installed. This package also depends on several third-party
packages:

* requests

* rfc3987

* six

To work with this package (maintain, use, run tests) you'll need to have these
third-party packages in your local Python environment.


Build and install
=================
To build the library and use, follow these steps:

#. Still to do -- write new instructions for build and install.

      Historical instructions from Prashant's original work

      .. highlight:: bash

      #. Clone the `repository from github
         <https://github.com/IMSGlobal/caliper-python.git>`_ into your desired
         application directory::

           git clone https://github.com/IMSGlobal/caliper-python.git

      #. Set the URL for your Sensor endpoint in :file:`caliper/options.py`.

      #. To test the project, run :file:`test-caliper.py` in the repository's top
         directory::

           python test-caliper.py

      #. Build the package, in the repository's top directory::

           python setup.py build

         If you need to create a distribution of the package, you can use these
         command lines (from the top directory) to build a binary, or source,
         distribution::

           python setup.py sdist
           python setup.py bdist

      #. Install the package into your local python environment::

           python setup.py install


      Using the library
      =================
      After installation, you can use the library in your code, like this:

      .. code-block:: python

         import caliper
         import caliper.utils

         # ... your code here

         caliper.init("YOUR_API_KEY", log_level

      Happy coding!
