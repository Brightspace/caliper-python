# Alternative License to be applicable to updates to the Caliper Analytics

# Licensees of IMS Global Caliper Analytics APIs are strongly encouraged to

# within IMS Global. Prospective licensees should understand that their initial
# base contribution and ongoing membership fees are insufficient to fully fund
# the ongoing development and maintenance of Caliper APIs and that voluntary
# contributions are the primary "fuel" ensuring any open source project's
# viability. Contributions can include development, bug fixing, bug reporting,
# performance analysis, and other aspects of the overall development process.

# Contributor status at the "github" level will be individual-based. Contributors
# will need to sign an IMS Global Contributor License Agreement (CLA) that grants
# IMS Global a license to contributions.
