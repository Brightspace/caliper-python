# IMS Global also makes available an Alternative License based on the GNU Lesser
# General Public License. LGPL v3 Licensees (via the Alternative License) are
# required to be IMS Global members. Membership in IMS is a commitment by a
# supplier to the IMS community for ongoing support for achieving "plug and play"
# integration.  IMS Membership dues pay for ongoing maintenance for the
# Alternative License to be applicable to updates to the Caliper Analytics
# APIs. The rationale for this dual-license approach and membership component is
# to help assure a requisite level of ongoing development, project management,
# and support for the software.

# Licensees of IMS Global Caliper Analytics APIs are strongly encouraged to
# become active contributors to the Caliper Analytics project and other projects
# within IMS Global. Prospective licensees should understand that their initial
# base contribution and ongoing membership fees are insufficient to fully fund
# the ongoing development and maintenance of Caliper APIs and that voluntary
# contributions are the primary "fuel" ensuring any open source project's
# viability. Contributions can include development, bug fixing, bug reporting,
# performance analysis, and other aspects of the overall development process.

# Contributor status at the "github" level will be individual-based. Contributors
# will need to sign an IMS Global Contributor License Agreement (CLA) that grants
# IMS Global a license to contributions.
